# Transaction Record in Stable
This structure is responsible for recording transactions made in the Stable system, both outbound and inbound values by the treasury will also be recorded here. However, unlike the treasury which records aggregated amounts for Stable generation, here are the individual records of customer transactions, in summary:

- Stable-to-Stable account transactions
- Transactions from within the Stable system to outside with PIX
- Transactions from outside the Stable system to inside receiving PIX
- Transactions involving customer account "hoarding and dehoarding"
- PIX/Stable payments
