# **Stable Account**

The Stable account structure is responsible for holding the balance of customers, it is our strongbox in the system where we keep all the necessary information about a customer's account.

    {
    _id: "56a4f3564",
    fiat_Id: "123456"
    holder: "Jo√£o Silva 123",
    balance: 5000,
    }

**I believe there are additional pieces of information that an account should store. However, since we are dealing with the expansion of an already-existing account, I will focus on the bare minimum necessary in this aspect. Only the essential information needed to perform operations will be included.**
