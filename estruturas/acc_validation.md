## Account Validation

The account validation system verifies various information of an account and the type of operation being performed.

    {
     _id: "123456",
     acount_Id: "56a4f3564",
     action: "10",
    }



The validation works in two stages, first identifying where it came from and to whom the validation belongs.

## Description
    _id:
Unique identifier automatically generated by the database.


    account_id:
Identifier of the account being validated.


    action:
Type of action being executed, which can be:

- `"10"`: Transfer

- `"20"`: Swap FIAT

- `"30"`: Payment


The validation is done in two steps. In the first step, the origin of the request and the ownership of the validation are identified. In the second step, the information from the document is used to validate the requested operation or generate a new error structure.

In the event of an error, the existing structure will be duplicated, and a new key-value pair will be added to represent the error type. This modified structure will then be returned.
    
            {
    _id: "123456",
    account_Id: "56a4f3564",
    action: "10",
    error_Handler: "3",
    }
