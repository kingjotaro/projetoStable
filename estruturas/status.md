# STatus

This structure is responsible for verifying the status of transactions in the STable transaction registry. All payments, transfers, and SWAPs are thoroughly checked to prevent any possibility of errors, fraud, or any other related issues that may arise during financial transactions. This ensures that each transaction is processed correctly and efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the system.
