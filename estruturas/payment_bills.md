# Payment Bills


This structure is similar to the one used in billing, but the difference is that we're now processing a payment. As a result, the payment bill includes an additional identification field to be used during validation.

        is_stable: True,

        action: "30"!,
        date: "16/04/2023",
        time: "07:00",
