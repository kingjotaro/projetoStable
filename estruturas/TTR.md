# Treasury Transaction Record

In this document, I present an idea of how Treasury Transaction Record should be performed.

The registration of Treasury transactions is our accounting book of security for the value of Stable. Here, all the input and output operations of the system will be recorded. Every time a Stable is generated or liquidated, it will be registered in this document. Here is an idea of how such a document could be organized.

     {
      _id: "123456",
      is_liquid: False,
      bond_type: "IPCA+",
      hoarding_date: "08/01/2025",
      maturity_date: "01/01/2050",
      purchase_date: "01/01/2025",
      sold_date: "",
      purchase_value: 1000,
      sold_value: "",
      total_bonds: 1000,
      unit_price: 1

    }
