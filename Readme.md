## The digital URV

Unfortunately, governments do not see the fight against inflation as a priority, and often it is the people who end up paying the bill through an invisible tax that heavily affects the poorest and small business owners. The general population usually doesn't have time to worry about financial protection, while large companies need to create a department just to handle their cash, and individuals and businesses often outsource this activity to a third party, trusting that they will manage it in the best possible way.

My idea to change this reality is simple and effective. A stable digital currency that is immune to inflation, based on government bonds that offer security and protection against inflation, in addition to a small return. This currency would make money much more efficient, allowing it to be spent at any time while still earning a return.

This initiative would offer ease and convenience for those who do not have the time or knowledge to organize their finances, making financial protection even more accessible and effective. All of this is based on a proposal that is inspired by the old URV model before the Real Plan, but with a completely digital approach.

The goal of the digital URV is to protect customers against inflation, and as soon as it is launched, it would have a parity value of 1:1 with the Real. After launch, its value would begin to fluctuate according to market pricing, and it would be fully backed by government bonds in a similar way to how the URV (Real Value Unit) of the Real Plan was anchored in the dollar. Any purchase made with Real prices could be converted to the Stable value, while the Real would still be the unit of account for our economy. The Stable would be an intelligent currency that is backed by government bonds, ensuring that it retains its value and is not affected by inflation when liquidated for Real.

There are several ways to capitalize on this type of service, one of the simplest being to maintain a spread between the appreciation value of the bond and that of the currency. Other methods can be better elaborated upon depending on the success of the Stable.
