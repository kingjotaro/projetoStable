# Planning

Part of this process is planning which bonds will be traded and defining which types of bonds the URV (Real Value Unit) will represent.

There are several options of bonds in the financial market, and the choice of which ones will be used as collateral for the Stable will impact its variation. In the case of the project in question, one option would be to use IPCA+ Treasury bonds, which offer greater stability to create an anti-inflation Stable. These bonds remunerate the inflation value plus a pre-fixed bonus, offering some predictability of the Stable's yield.

However, it is also possible to explore other options, such as creating a more volatile currency indexed to a stock index. Although this option has a greater market fluctuation, it could be a great financial instrument for leveraging and facilitating investment.

After defining the strategy, it is necessary to define the project structure for implementation. One possible way to structure the project is to base it on simple codes, creating a pilot project that can be used as a reference for the implementation of the digital currency in the bank. This process must be carefully planned and executed to ensure the security and stability of the new Stable and, consequently, the success of the project as a whole.
